Simple xDAQ application that connects to a DB, methods to access the values and 
insert new ones are applied using tstore client

###################################

1.- Compilation 

    make  (first need to set the environment variables as in any xdaq app)

2.- Execution

    export TSTORE_XML=$PWD/views/   (View files define which table we will look at)
    xdaq.sh  -p 12345 -c $PWD/xml/hellotstore.xml -e $PWD/xml/hellotstore.profile

3. In the browser 

   Once inside the browser

   http://gem904daq01.cern.ch:12345/urn:xdaq-application:lid=121/query  (somehow by just clicking the query link does not work 
   need to fix it)


4. Values for the AMC13 table are stored in xdata::Table format and printed out in terminal

5. Insert functionality can be added as well (in progress)
